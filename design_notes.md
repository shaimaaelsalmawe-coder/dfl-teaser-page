# Slack Design Observations for DFL Teaser Page

## 1. Typography & Hierarchy
- Large, bold headings (Black or Extra Bold).
- Use of "Display" fonts for impact.
- Clear distinction between headings and body text.
- Sub-headings often have icons or small labels above them.

## 2. Layout Patterns
- **Alternating Sections:** Text on left/Image on right, then vice versa.
- **Card-based Layouts:** Rounded corners (3xl or more), subtle borders, and soft shadows.
- **Grid Systems:** 3-column grids for features or stats.
- **Large Spacing:** Extensive use of padding (py-24 or more) to let content breathe.
- **Interactive Tabs:** Using tabs to switch between different feature categories.

## 3. Visual Elements
- **Rounded Corners:** Everything is very rounded (buttons, cards, sections).
- **Subtle Backgrounds:** Off-white or very light gray backgrounds to separate sections.
- **Iconography:** Use of clean, simple icons (Lucide-react is perfect for this).
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Using accordions (FAQ) or "Learn More" links to keep the page clean.
- **Stats with Impact:** Large numbers with descriptive text.

## 4. Interaction & Feel
- **Hover States:** Subtle scale-up or background color change.
- **Smooth Transitions:** Everything feels fluid.
- **Gen Z Appeal:** Clean, modern, "tech-forward" but friendly.

## 5. Specific Section Ideas for DFL
- **Programs Section:** Instead of just a carousel, maybe a grid of cards with "Slack-like" hover effects.
- **Mission Section:** Use a large, bold statement with a high-contrast background (already has this, but can be refined).
- **FAQ Section:** Clean, borderless or subtle border accordions.
- **CTA Section:** Large, rounded container with a gradient or solid bold color.
